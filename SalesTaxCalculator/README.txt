PROBLEM: SALES TAXES
 
Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medical products that are exempt. Import duty is an additional sales tax applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions.
 
When I purchase items I receive a receipt which lists the name of all the items and their price (including tax), finishing with the total cost of the items, and the total amounts of sales taxes paid.  The rounding rules for sales tax are that for a tax rate of n%, a shelf price of p contains (np/100 rounded up to the nearest 0.05) amount of sales tax.
 
Write an application that prints out the receipt details for these shopping baskets...

===================================

SOLUTION:

1) Implemented Decorator design pattern for tax calculation

2) Create dynamic model for item cart - add, remove items, etc.
 
3) Program read input from file system

4) Program handles input errors:

	i. error:source\data4.txt (The system cannot find the file specified)

	ii. data is corrupt: kjk dsf dfd at sfd


Assumption:

1) Imported item has a word "imported" in the item name

2) Program has a list of exempt item names (ItemUtil.isExempt method)


Example how to run program with multiple inputs from files.

c:\opt>java -jar salestax.jar source/data1.txt source/data2.txt source/data3.txt
